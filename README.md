# What's this?
This is a project of mine designed to play audio files to multiple users connected to the same webpage, synchronizing them in the process. I'd like to implement queues, rooms and other neat features for listening along. The webserver is written in Node.js and the frontend is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## TODO
* Queue
* Volume Slider
* Song List Filter
* Song List Search Bar (Filter)
* Parties
* Song Request System
* Audio Visualizer
